# Make Change Project

### Description
This is my very first Java project while at SD.
I used the if-else-if nested loop to finish this project.
In the project, twentyHund, tenHund, fiveHund, oneHund,quartHund,dimeHund, nickleHun
and pennyHund all means these price times 100. The reason why i did so is that we have not learned the round() operation,
and we can not only keep the two digit decimal for double data type values.
And for the rstAmt means that the total money should be returned to the customer if the money tendered is more than the price.
All the quto variables mean that they are the quotation for the operation.
All the remd variables mean that they are reminders for the operation.



## What I learned
I learned that they are many different ways to write the code, right now, my code is too long and I am still learning
how to make the code looks clean and easy to read.


## Technologies Used
Java, Eclipse,Git,Terminal
